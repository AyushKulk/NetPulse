⚡ NetPulse: Intelligent Edge AI for Real-Time Network Diagnostics
💡 Inspiration
Every minute of network downtime costs enterprises thousands of dollars — yet most monitoring systems are reactive, not preventive.
We wanted to change that by giving users — from everyday households to enterprise IT teams — a live, intelligent pulse on their network performance.
With the help of the T-Mobile 5G Network, a Raspberry Pi, and an Arduino hardware kit, we set out to build NetPulse, an embedded AI system that brings predictive network diagnostics to the edge.

🚀 What It Does
NetPulse is an end-to-end, real-time intelligent system that:
🔹 Collects environmental, motion, and system metrics from onboard sensors (temperature, humidity, CPU load, ping latency, packet loss, etc.)
🔹 Processes and classifies this data through an edge anomaly detection model running locally on the Raspberry Pi
🔹 Streams all metrics and AI insights to a mobile dashboard via Firestore and an MCP Server, providing instant visualization and personalized optimization tips

📱 Mobile App Features:

📊 Live graphs of network health metrics (latency, stability, Wi-Fi signal, etc.)
🧠 AI-powered diagnostics & recommendations (e.g., “Reduce router distance” or “High packet loss detected — potential interference”)
⚡ Realtime data sync between Arduino → Phone → MCP Server → Firestore
🛠️ How We Built It
🔧 Hardware: Arduino + environmental & IMU sensors to capture physical and performance parameters
🌐 Networking: T-Mobile 5G backbone for stable and fast data transmission
🐍 Backend: Python-based Firestore pipeline for structured logging and real-time analytics
🤖 AI Layer: Anomaly detection model trained to identify irregular system behavior and generate contextual diagnostics — integrated with an MCP Server running Claude Sonnet 4.5
📲 Frontend: Mobile app interface for live metric visualization and AI feedback
