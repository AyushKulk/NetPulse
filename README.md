## Inspiration Every minute of network downtime costs enterprises thousands of dollars ‚Äî yet most monitoring systems are reactive, not preventive. We wanted to change that by giving users ‚Äî from everyday households to enterprise IT teams ‚Äî a live, intelligent pulse on their network performance. With the help of the **T-Mobile 5G Network**, a *Raspberry Pi*, and an Arduino hardware kit, we set out to build NetPulse, an embedded AI system that brings predictive network diagnostics to the edge. ## What it does NetPulse is an end-to-end, real-time system that: * Collects environmental, motion, and system metrics from onboard sensors (temperature, humidity, CPU load, ping latency, packet loss, etc.) * Processes and classifies this data through an edge anomaly detection model running on the Raspberry Pi * Streams all metrics and AI insights to a mobile dashboard via Firestore and an MCP Server, providing instant visualization and personalized optimization tips Mobile App: üì± Live graphs of network health metrics (latency, stability, Wi-Fi signal, etc.) üß† AI-powered diagnostics & recommendations (e.g., ‚ÄúReduce router distance‚Äù or ‚ÄúHigh packet loss detected ‚Äî potential interference‚Äù) ‚ö° Realtime data sync between Arduino ‚Üí Phone ‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üí Firestore ## How we built it Hardware: Arduino + environmental & IMU sensors to capture physical and performance parameters Networking: T-Mobile 5G backbone for stable and fast data transmission Backend: Python-based Firestore pipeline for structured logging and real-time analytics AI Layer: Anomaly detection model trained to identify irregular system behavior and generate contextual diagnostics in conjunction with an MCP Server running Claude Sonnet 4.5 Frontend: Mobile app interface for live metric visualization and AI feedback ## Challenges we ran into * Building a robust data pipeline from Arduino ‚Üí mobile ‚Üí MCP ‚Üí Firestore with low latency * Managing real-time data synchronization between Arduino and Raspberry Pi sensors * Ensuring consistent sensor calibration and normalization that makes sense for model inference * Designing an ML model that works well with a small collection of noisy, unlabeled data ## Accomplishments that we're proud of * End-to-end integration across hardware, AI, and cloud; fully functional live demo * Successfully collected and parsed thousands of real-world sensor readings * Built a responsive mobile UI that visualizes real-time network health * Developed a modular ML inference architecture for edge-to-cloud deployment ## What we learned * How system-level metrics like packet loss, CPU load, and Wi-Fi signal strength can predict instability before users notice * The importance of cleaning and scaling sensor data for reliable ML predictions * How to design for resilience; fault-tolerant data flow from embedded to cloud ## What's next for NetPulse? * Expanding the anomaly detection model with larger, labeled datasets * Integrating on-device model inference for fully offline network diagnostics * Building predictive analytics dashboards for enterprise IT teams * Exploring T-Mobile 5G APIs to automatically trigger optimizations on network events
